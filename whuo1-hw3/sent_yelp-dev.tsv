901	1	Spend your money elsewhere.
902	2	Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!
903	1	The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
904	1	And the drinks are WEAK, people!
905	1	-My order was not correct.
906	1	Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.
907	1	After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
908	2	The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
909	1	We won't be returning.
910	2	This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
911	1	I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
912	1	Very, very sad.
913	1	i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?
914	1	How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!
915	1	I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
916	1	The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur√©ed.
917	1	There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better
918	1	I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
919	1	They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
920	1	What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.
921	1	Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.
922	1	This place is disgusting!
923	2	Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.
924	1	The RI style calamari was a joke.
925	1	However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.
926	1	I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.
927	1	It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.
928	1	It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
929	1	We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
930	1	Disappointing experience.
931	1	The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.
932	1	If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.
933	1	WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
934	1	We won't be going back.
935	1	The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
936	1	This place lacked style!!
937	1	The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.
938	1	Don't bother coming here.
939	1	The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.
940	1	The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.
941	1	It was equally awful.
942	1	Probably not in a hurry to go back.
943	1	very slow at seating even with reservation.
944	1	Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
945	1	The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
946	1	The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.
947	1	It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.
948	1	I was VERY disappointed!!
949	1	This place is horrible and way overpriced.
950	1	Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.
951	1	It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
952	1	The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
953	1	The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.
954	1	Con: spotty service.
955	1	The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.
956	1	But then they came back cold.
957	1	Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.
958	1	The real disappointment was our waiter.
959	1	My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
960	1	The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
961	1	Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.
962	1	If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
963	1	She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
964	1	After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
965	1	Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
966	1	It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
967	1	But I don't like it.
968	1	Hell no will I go back
969	1	We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
970	1	I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".
971	1	I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
972	1	The ambiance isn't much better.
973	1	Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
974	1	The food wasn't good.
975	1	Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.
976	1	What happened next was pretty....off putting.
977	1	too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.
978	1	Overpriced for what you are getting.
979	1	I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
980	1	I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.
981	1	I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.
982	1	We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
983	1	Food was below average.
984	1	It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
985	1	All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.
986	1	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
987	1	Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
988	1	It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.
989	1	It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
990	1	I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
991	1	The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
992	1	Spend your money and time some place else.
993	1	A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
994	1	the presentation of the food was awful.
995	1	I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
996	1	I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
997	1	Appetite instantly gone.
998	1	Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
999	1	The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.
1000	1	Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.
